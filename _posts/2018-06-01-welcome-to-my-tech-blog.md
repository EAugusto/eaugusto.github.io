Welcome to my tech blog!

It has been a while since I've been anxious to share some experiences with you so here I am!
I think that we're more connected than never and the internet has unlocked a huge potential.

## Crowd-learning!
_We can learn by interacting with each other._

I believe that we'll end up better off sharing experiences.
Let's start to walk this road together!

Thanks,

Eduardo Augusto Benigno da Silva
